* IAS-SS

** Abstract
IAS-SS (Inverse Ant System-based Surveillance System) is a [[http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/][Player/Stage]] based C++ implementation of the bio-inspired control architecture presented in the
following papers:

  1) R. Calvo et al. "/Inverse ACO for Exploration and Surveillance in Unknown Environments/", The Third International Conference on Advanced Cognitive Technologies and Applications, Rome, Italy 2011.
  2) R. Calvo et al. "/A Distributed, Bio-Inspired Coordination Strategy for Multiple Agent Systems Applied to Surveillance Tasks in Unknown Environments/", Proc. of the IEEE IJCNN, San Jose, USA, 2011.

This is being developed as part of the Robotics and Bio-Inspired Learning graduate course at UCV.

Future versions of this README file will include a technical report on the developed software.

** Notes

The file ~maps/cave.png~ is part of the standard Stage distribution.
